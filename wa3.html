<p>This is an brief exploration on the gamestock and amc stock market explosions due to the reddit organization and formation to run these stock prices up in order for reddit users to make money</p>

<p> I think these online communities should be used as they did in this incidence to take over certain capital that is usually excluded to those people and groups who have incredible amounts of finances that allow them to help control these markets and stocks.</p>


<p> I think that although these organizations have a responsibility to protect market stabilization and certain peoples best interests, in making these platforms they have enabled people to do these stunts. i dont think they should be monitoring this. </p>

<p> I really did enjoy this exploration into unknown territory of the stock market. It seems fitting that these disruptions occur after these markets are becoming more and more focused on being accesible to people who can afford full stocks due to high prices and what not.  </p>

<p>"GameStop’s explosive rise — it was up over 600 percent in a matter of days — was powered by a remarkable online campaign. Retail investors gathering on Reddit and other social media sites sought to “squeeze” hedge funds that had been using short sales in a bet they could profit from a decline in the struggling retailer’s share price.

The plan worked, upending the longstanding balance of power on Wall Street as retail traders inflicted painful losses on hedge funds and piled up huge gains. But those winnings have mostly unwound this week.

“The incredible spike in volatility told you it wasn’t sustainable,” said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at the brokerage firm BTIG. “We’re back to your regularly scheduled bull market, already in progress.”</p>




<p> The broader market did return to climbing, a march that had stalled after investors were unnerved by last week’s surge in idiosyncratic stocks. The S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent to close at a new high.

When retail traders flooded into the shares of GameStop and other shorted stocks, the surge forced the hedge funds stuck in the squeeze to sell off stocks they would have otherwise kept in order to raise funds. That dynamic helped drive the broader stock market down last week and pushed the S&P 500 to a loss of 1.1 percent in January.

The short squeeze was highly profitable for some investors who were buying those once-beleaguered shares, if they sold early enough to lock in the gains. The collapse in prices of GameStop shares since their intraday peak on Thursday last week — shortly before brokerage firms began to curtail trading in some of the most heavily traded meme stocks — has destroyed roughly $30 billion in market value.

Any investors who got into the stock during the peak of the excitement are going to be carrying large losses.“It was obvious to many market participants that this thing had run up so far and so fast it behooved people to take profits if they had them,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers in Greenwich, Conn. “If two-thirds of the market cap of a company evaporates in a couple of days, it’s not going to be pleasant for a lot of holders”" -New York Times, Matt Phillips
