<p class="center">DATA SET CONTEXT : The Chernobyl disaster started in 1986's April 26th, when the Chernobyl's nuclear power plant reactor caught on fire, lasting for 10 days, resulting in the unprecedented release of radioactive material from a nuclear reactor. The power plant is located at 100 km from Kievin (Ukraine), but the effects of this accident reached far beyond its country borders.

The three most affected countries were Belarus, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine, but the accident's consequences were not limited to those territories. Several other European countries were affected by it, due to a massive atmospheric transfer of radioactive material. Until this day, the real impact of this event is still under controversy.

The assessment of the radionuclide intake with food and drinking water was based primarily on several measurements of I-131, Cs-134, and Cs-137 that were performed all over Europe [1], which are the radioisotopes reported in this dataset. </p>

<p id="para1" >The Explosion
The first episode of this show documents the explosion of the reactor on the night of the incident. It shows the negligence of the control room workers and how they were treating the nuclear reactor like a toy or something and not a nuclear reactor that needed to be closely monitored by professionals and by the textbook to ensure safety. They highlight how there was a "unit shirt chief" who was in charge of the safety test that ultimately was the cause of the disaster. It was his efforts who took charge in trying to run a safety test at night with an untrained night crew, and while also not respecting the power and safety levels of the reactor itself. </p>
<p>The Clean Up efforts
From the time that the reactor exploded until months after there were USSR crews working around the clock to help contain the spread of the explosion as well as the intense radiation. There were two men in charge of the clean-up efforts,

and Boris Shcherbina.

These two men were the ones who were in charge originally to contain the explosion and reactivity and handle the project altogether. They were put in charge of this position before knowing the ultimate scope of the disaster </p>
<p>What we learned
The show was fascinating in that we learned lot of information pertaining to life in the USSR, the Chernobly nuclear disaster, how it happened and how big of a disaster it truly was. We also learned a lot about the Soviet ignorance and obsession with not being humiliated and always trying to portray information in the best way possible regardless of how many lies need to be told or what needs to be covered up. </p>
<p>Conclusion
This show was a fascinating dive into the Chernobyl event and the mitigation efforts that followed. Although a rather dark mini-series portraying people dying of radiation poisoning and having to give their lives for their country but all because of the ignorance of the "unit shift chief" who wanted to run that safety test so they could report one as completed. </p>
